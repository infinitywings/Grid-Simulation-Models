in this cosim testbed we are considering 1-transmission system and 2 distribution systems
that we want to control the EVs of one of the distribution systems.

1. i chose the 300-bus transmission system, but my machine could not handle it! so i chose the 9-bus system instead and the cosim could run successfully.

2. here, we have a 9-bus transmission system and 2 123-node-distribution systems , one of this glm1 files have 6 EV stations that EV1 is atteched to a battery energy storage sytem that will be connected to this storage during the peak demand as an islanded sytem. also, we are using the california traffic patterns for 3 EV statyions (EV1, EV6, and EV5).
